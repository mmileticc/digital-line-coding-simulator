Digital Line Coding Simulator
This project is a Python-based simulator that demonstrates and visualizes various digital line coding techniques. It includes:

Generation of random binary sequences with customizable probabilities

Encoding using common line codes:
  Unipolar NRZ / RZ
  Polar NRZ / RZ
  Manchester
  AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion)
  M-ary line coding (4-level and 8-level)
  Statistical analysis (mean and RMS values)
  Visualization of waveform signals using matplotlib

Features
  Reproducible signal generation and visualization
  Easy comparison of signal power and average levels
  Educational tool for understanding digital transmission methods

Requirements
  Python 3.x
  NumPy
  Matplotlib

Educational use only â€“ great for signal processing, communications, or digital systems classes.
